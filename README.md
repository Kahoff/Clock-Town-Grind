# Clock-Town-Grind
Simple Adventure Game 
Version 1.0

Kyle Hoffmann - March 06/15

A simple Rpg where the player must travel to 4 reigons to collect their orb of power.
  The player can visit Town, Forest, Ocean, Mountians, and Desert. They can rest in town to
  recover hp, or adventure in the other reigions to possibly find an orb, or fight monsters.
  
Presently the only way to get stronger is to collect the orbs. While it is possible to collect
  the orbs in any order it is suggested to search in the order, Town, Forest, Ocean, Mountians, and Desert.
  
For testing, open the file realted to each reigion (ie. desert.cpp) and change the "searchChance" check on line 29 to a 
  smaller number. the number entered is (100-"number chosen")% chance of finding the orb.
